It appears that there is no file provided to analyze in C#. However, I can provide you with an equivalent Python class structure that you can use to read and analyze a file:

```python
class FileAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, file_name):
        self.file_path = file_name

    def analyze_file(self):
        try:
            with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                # Perform analysis on the file content here
                # For example, counting the number of lines
                line_count = sum(1 for line in file)
                print(f"Number of lines in the file: {line_count}")

        except FileNotFoundError:
            print("File not found.")

# Example usage
file_analyzer = FileAnalyzer('sample.txt')
file_analyzer.analyze_file()
```

You can use this Python class to analyze a text file by providing the file name as the input. The `analyze_file` method reads the file and performs the desired analysis on its content.
