Since there is no specific file provided in the question, I will provide an example of analyzing a text file in C# and then writing the equivalent class in Python for reference.

C# code to analyze a text file:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string filePath = "sample.txt";

        if (File.Exists(filePath))
        {
            string[] lines = File.ReadAllLines(filePath);

            foreach (string line in lines)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(line);
            }
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("File does not exist.");
        }
    }
}
```

Equivalent Python class to read and analyze a text file:

```python
class FileAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, file_path):
        self.file_path = file_path

    def analyze_file(self):
        try:
            with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                for line in file:
                    print(line.strip())
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print("File does not exist.")

file_analyzer = FileAnalyzer("sample.txt")
file_analyzer.analyze_file()
```

In the Python class `FileAnalyzer`, we define a method `analyze_file` that reads the contents of the specified text file and prints each line. If the file does not exist, it prints a corresponding message. This is similar to the C# code provided above, but written in Python syntax.
