The WebApiApplication class in this C# code is responsible for initializing the application when it starts. The key logic in this class is in the Populate_DB_If_None method, which checks if the database exists and populates it with data if it does not.

1. In the Application_Start method, the GlobalConfiguration is configured by calling the Register method in the WebApiConfig class.

2. The Populate_DB_If_None method creates a new instance of the UnishopEntities context.

3. It checks if the database exists by calling the Database.Exists() method on the context.

4. If the database does not exist, it creates the database using context.Database.Create().

5. It then directly connects to the database using SqlConnection and adds a computed column to the inventory table using a SQL statement. This is done because EF6 cannot generate computed columns with a database-first approach.

6. It reads data from a CSV file named unicorns.csv located in the application directory.

7. It iterates over each line in the CSV file, parses the fields, and creates a new inventory object with the parsed data.

8. These new inventory objects are added to a list.

9. The list of new inventory objects is then added to the context using context.inventories.AddRange().

10. Finally, the SaveChanges() method is called on the context to persist the changes to the database.

Overall, this class initializes the application by configuring the Web API routes and populating the database with initial data if the database does not already exist.
