This class is a partial class named `basket` within the namespace `UnicornShopLegacy`. It contains four properties:

1. `basket_id` of type `System.Guid`: This property represents the unique identifier for the basket.
2. `user_id` of type `System.Guid`: This property represents the unique identifier for the user associated with the basket.
3. `unicorn_id` of type `System.Guid`: This property represents the unique identifier for the unicorn in the basket.
4. `creation_date` of type `System.DateTime`: This property represents the date and time when the basket was created.

The class appears to be a data model representing a basket within a legacy Unicorn Shop application. It provides properties to store information related to the basket, such as the user and unicorn associated with it, as well as the creation date. It is likely used to interact with a database or other data storage mechanism to persist and retrieve basket information. The comment at the beginning of the class indicates that this code was generated from a template and manual changes may cause unexpected behavior.
