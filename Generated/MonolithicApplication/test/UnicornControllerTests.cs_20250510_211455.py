This class contains unit tests for the UnicornController class in a legacy Unicorn shop application. The class tests various methods of the UnicornController class to ensure that they behave as expected.

The Init method initializes the test by setting up the UnishopDbContext and UnicornController.

The GetUnicorns_WhenCalled_ReturnTwoUnicorns test verifies that the GetUnicorns method of the UnicornController returns a list of two unicorns.

The GetUnicorns_WhenCalled_ReturnIQueriableOfUnicorn test verifies that the GetUnicorns method returns an IQueryable of inventory objects.

The GetUnicorn_ExistingUnicornId_ReturnOkResult test checks if the GetUnicorn method returns an OkNegotiatedContentResult with the correct unicorn id if the unicorn exists.

The GetUnicorn_NonExistingUnicornId_ReturnNotFoundResult test ensures that the GetUnicorn method returns a NotFoundResult if the unicorn does not exist.

The PutUnicorn_InvalidModel_ReturnInvalidModelState test checks whether the PutUnicorn method returns an InvalidModelStateResult when passed an invalid model.

The PutUnicorn_DifferentId_ReturnBadRequest test verifies that the PutUnicorn method returns a BadRequestResult when updating a unicorn with a different id.

The PutUnicorn_AsyncSaveSucceed_ReturnNoContent test ensures that the PutUnicorn method returns a NoContent status code if the save operation is successful.

The PutUnicorn_AsyncSaveFailAndUnicornExists_ThrowException test checks if an exception is thrown when the save operation fails and the unicorn exists.

The PutUnicorn_AsyncSaveFailAndUnicornNotExists_ReturnNotFound test verifies that a NotFoundResult is returned when the save operation fails and the unicorn does not exist.

The PostUnicorn_InvalidModel_ReturnInvalidModelState test ensures that the PostUnicorn method returns an InvalidModelStateResult when passed an invalid model.

The PostUnicorn_WhenCalled_UnicornInList test verifies that a unicorn is added to the list when calling the PostUnicorn method.

The PostUnicorn_WhenCalled_ReDirectToDefaultAPI test ensures that the PostUnicorn method redirects to the default API route.

The DeleteUnicorn_UnicornNotFound_ReturnNotFound test checks if a NotFoundResult is returned when attempting to delete a non-existing unicorn.

The DeleteUnicorn_UnicornFound_DeleteUnicornFromList test verifies that a unicorn is removed from the list when calling the DeleteUnicorn method.

The DeleteUnicorn_UnicornFound_ReturnOk test ensures that the DeleteUnicorn method returns an OkNegotiatedContentResult with the deleted unicorn data.

Overall, these unit tests cover various scenarios for the UnicornController class to ensure its functionality and behavior.
