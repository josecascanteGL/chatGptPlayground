This class `WebApiApplication` is the main entry point for the application when it starts. It inherits from `System.Web.HttpApplication` and contains the `Application_Start()` method which is called when the application starts.

The `Application_Start()` method calls `Populate_DB_If_None()` method and `GlobalConfiguration.Configure(WebApiConfig.Register)`. This method registers the Web API routes defined in the `WebApiConfig` class.

The `Populate_DB_If_None()` method checks if the database exists and if not, it creates the database, adds a computed column to the `inventory` table using a SQL statement, and populates the database with data from a CSV file (`unicorns.csv`). It reads the file, parses the data, creates `inventory` objects, adds them to the database context, and saves changes.

Overall, the logic in this class ensures that the database is properly initialized when the application starts and populates it with initial data if it does not exist.
