// This class is auto-generated by Entity Framework and represents the data model for the UnicornShop application.
// It is linked to the UnicornShop.edmx file which contains the Entity Data Model.
// The comments above provide instructions on how to customize the code generation strategy and update the model from the database.

// It is recommended to not modify this class directly, but to update the model using the Entity Framework designer tools.
// These tools allow you to easily update the database schema, generate entity classes, and update the context class.

// This class will contain properties that correspond to the tables in the database, representing the entities in the application.
// These properties can be used to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations.

// Overall, this class serves as the bridge between the application code and the database, allowing for data manipulation and retrieval.
