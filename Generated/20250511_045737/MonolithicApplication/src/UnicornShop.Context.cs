// This code is part of the UnicornShopLegacy namespace, which contains the UnishopEntities class.
// The UnishopEntities class inherits from DbContext, which is part of Entity Framework, for managing a database context.

// The constructor UnishopEntities initializes the UnishopEntities context with a connection string named "UnishopEntities".

// The OnModelCreating method is overridden to throw an UnintentionalCodeFirstException if it's called. This prevents accidental code-first migrations.

// The UnishopEntities class has DbSets for three entities: baskets, users, and inventories. These properties represent tables in the database.
