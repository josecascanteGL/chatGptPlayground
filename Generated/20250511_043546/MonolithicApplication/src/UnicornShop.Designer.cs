// This file is generated by T4 code generation based on the UnicornShop.edmx model file.
// To switch to legacy code generation, change the 'Code Generation Strategy' property to 'Legacy ObjectContext'.

// If context and entity classes are not generated, it could be due to not selecting the Entity Framework version.
// To generate classes, right-click on the designer surface and choose options like 'Update Model from Database'.

// It is important to specify the correct Entity Framework version and generate the necessary classes to work with the model.
