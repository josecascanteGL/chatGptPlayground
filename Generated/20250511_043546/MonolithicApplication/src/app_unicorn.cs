// This code defines a class called app_unicorn in the UnicornShopLegacy namespace.
// The class has several properties representing attributes of a unicorn, such as its ID, name, description, price, etc.
// Each property has a getter and setter method to access and modify the values.
// The Guid type is used for the unicorn_id property to uniquely identify each unicorn.
// The Nullable type is used for properties that can have a null value, such as active, price, and date_create.
// The class is marked as partial, which allows for the definition of the class to be split across multiple files.
