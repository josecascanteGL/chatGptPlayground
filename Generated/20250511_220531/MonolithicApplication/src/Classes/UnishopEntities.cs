/*
* This code is a partial class that implements the IUnishopEntities interface.
* It contains a method SetModified that takes an object entity as a parameter.
* Within the method, it sets the state of the entity to EntityState.Modified using the Entry method of the current UnishopEntities instance.
* The purpose of this class is to provide a mockable method instead of directly using the Entry method.
