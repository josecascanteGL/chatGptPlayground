This C# class `WebApiApplication` is the entry point for the application. Here is an analysis of the logic in the class:

1. The `Application_Start` method is called when the application starts. It first calls the `Populate_DB_If_None` method to populate the database if it is empty and then configures the Global Web API routes using `WebApiConfig.Register`.

2. The `Populate_DB_If_None` method checks if the database exists. If it does not exist, it creates the database.

3. It then establishes a direct connection to the database using a SQL connection string and adds a computed column `year_model` to the `inventory` table using a SQL statement. This is done because computed columns cannot be generated by Entity Framework (EF6) in a database-first approach.

4. It reads the data from a CSV file (`unicorns.csv`) that contains information about unicorns (id, name, description, price, image, creation date).

5. For each line in the CSV file, it creates a new `inventory` object, fills it with the data from the CSV file, and adds it to a list of `inventory` objects (`newunicorns`).

6. Finally, it adds all the new `inventory` objects to the context and saves the changes to the database.

Overall, this class ensures that the database is populated with unicorn data from a CSV file and adds a computed column to the `inventory` table using SQL statements.
