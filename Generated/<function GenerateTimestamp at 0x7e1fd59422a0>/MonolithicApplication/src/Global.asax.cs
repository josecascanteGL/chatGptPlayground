This class is an implementation of a Web API application in C#. The logic in this class includes initializing the application, checking if the database exists, creating the database if it does not exist, and populating the database with data from a CSV file.

The `Application_Start` method is called when the application starts. It first checks if the database exists using the `Populate_DB_If_None` method. If the database does not exist, it creates the database and populates it with data.

The `Populate_DB_If_None` method first creates a new instance of the `UnishopEntities` context. It then checks if the database exists and if not, it creates the database using `context.Database.Create()`. 

After creating the database, it then connects directly to the database using a `SqlConnection` object and executes a SQL statement to add a computed column (`year_model`) to the `inventory` table.

It then reads the data from a CSV file (`unicorns.csv`), processes each line, creates a new `inventory` object for each line, populates the object with data from the CSV file, and adds the new inventory objects to the context using `context.inventories.AddRange(newunicorns)`.

Finally, it saves the changes to the database using `context.SaveChanges()`.

Overall, the logic in this class checks for the existence of the database, creates the database if it does not exist, and populates the database with data from a CSV file.
