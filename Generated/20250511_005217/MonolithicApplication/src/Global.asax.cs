This class is responsible for initializing the application when it starts. It contains a method called `Application_Start` which is called when the application starts. 

In the `Application_Start` method, the `Populate_DB_If_None` method is called. This method creates a new instance of the `UnishopEntities` context and checks if the database exists. If the database does not exist, it creates the database using `context.Database.Create()`.

After creating the database, a SQL connection is established to add a computed column to the `inventory` table by executing a SQL statement using `SqlDataAdapter`. This computed column is added as `year_model` which extracts the year from the `date_create` column.

Then, the method reads data from a CSV file `unicorns.csv` which contains information about unicorns. Each line in the CSV file is split into fields and used to create new instances of the `inventory` class. These instances are then added to the context using `context.inventories.AddRange()` and saved to the database using `context.SaveChanges()`.

Overall, the logic in this class ensures that the database is initialized with necessary data when the application starts.
