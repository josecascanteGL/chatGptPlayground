This C# class represents the application logic for a legacy Unicorn Shop web API. Here is a breakdown of the logic documented with comments:

- The `WebApiApplication` class inherits from `System.Web.HttpApplication` class, which represents an ASP.NET application.

- The `Application_Start` method is called when the application starts. It first checks if the database exists and populates it if it doesn't.

- The `Populate_DB_If_None` method creates an instance of the `UnishopEntities` context.

- If the database doesn't exist, it creates the database.

- It then establishes a direct SQL connection to the database to add a computed column called `year_model` to the `inventory` table. This is done using a SQL statement as EF6 does not support generating computed columns in database-first approach.

- It reads data from a CSV file named `unicorns.csv` located in the current server's path and populates a list of `inventory` objects with the data.

- Each line in the CSV file is split into fields and mapped to the properties of an `inventory` object.

- These `inventory` objects are added to the context's `inventories` collection.

- Finally, the changes are saved to the database.

Overall, the `WebApiApplication` class initializes the application by checking and populating the database if necessary, including adding computed columns and seeding data from a CSV file into the database.
