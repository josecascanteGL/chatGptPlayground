This C# class is the entry point for the web application and is responsible for initializing the application and populating the database if it is empty.

1. The `Application_Start` method is called when the application starts. It first calls the `Populate_DB_If_None` method to check if the database is empty and populates it if necessary. It then configures the global web API routes.

2. The `Populate_DB_If_None` method creates an instance of the `UnishopEntities` class (presumably an Entity Framework context) to check if the database exists. If the database does not exist, it creates the database.

3. The method then establishes a connection to the database using ADO.NET `SqlConnection` and executes a SQL statement to add a computed column (`year_model`) to the `inventory` table in the database. This is done directly in SQL because Entity Framework does not support generating computed columns in a database-first approach.

4. Next, the method reads data from a CSV file (`unicorns.csv`) located in the application directory. It then parses each line in the file, creates a new `inventory` object for each row, populates its properties with the data from the CSV file, and adds it to a list of new unicorns.

5. Finally, the method adds all the new unicorn objects to the `inventories` collection in the Entity Framework context and saves the changes to the database.

Overall, this class ensures that the database is populated with initial data when the application starts, and it includes logic to create a computed column and import data from a CSV file into the database.
