// This code defines a class called "basket" in the UnicornShopLegacy namespace
// The class has four properties: basket_id, user_id, unicorn_id, and creation_date
// Each property corresponds to a specific data type: System.Guid or System.DateTime
// The properties are set up as public, meaning they can be accessed from outside the class.
